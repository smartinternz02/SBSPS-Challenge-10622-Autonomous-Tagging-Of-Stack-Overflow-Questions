Imagine you're working on a project everything's going fine until the code breaks somewhere, you're facing an error, what would you do ü§î?<br><br>
You google it (after GPT fails :) and go on... StackOverflow! But the question that you see is not solving the bug. You keep on searching until you find the solution which is indeed on StackOverflow.<br><br>
Why did it take so long? You find out the question was not tagged properly, which affects the search results of such a big platform and ended up wasting your time üòï!
