Imagine you're working on a project everything's going fine until the code breaks somewhere, you're facing an error, what would you do 🤔?<br><br>
You google it (after GPT fails :) and go on... StackOverflow! But the question that you see is not solving the bug. You keep on searching until you find the solution which is indeed on StackOverflow.<br><br>
Why did it take so long? You find out the question was not tagged properly, which affectes the search results of such a big platform and ended up wasting your time 😕!

   ```
    python3 -m venv .env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment
   ```
   source .env/bin/activate
   ```

4. Run setup.py for installing necessary libraries and files
   ```
    python setup.py
